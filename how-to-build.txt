HOW TO BUILD:
=============

SmartStore.NET package with source code contains the "ClickToBuild.cmd" batch file, which will deploy everything correctly for you 
to a "Stage" folder. The build process will build the project in release mode and move all 
compiled and deployable files to the correct directory: "build/Web"

SmartStore.NET source code distribution does NOT contain the NuGet packages required to succesfully build the solution.
Instead these packages are downloaded during the very first compilation. Thus, when your initial build attempt fails, 
this could indicate that the packages could not be downloaded completely yet. In this case, just build again! 
If you're still getting errors, try to compile the solution in Visual Studio 2013 before running the .bat file, but
before make sure that 'SmartStore.Web' is set as your startup project.

After a successful build, select all the files in the "build\Web" directory and upload them to your web server.
