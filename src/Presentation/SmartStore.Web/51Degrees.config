    <!--<redirect> element controls how requests from mobile devices are handled.
    mobileHomePageUrl   Previously mobileRedirectUrl under the mobile/toolkit element.
                        A url to direct mobile devices to instead of the normal web sites 
                        landing page. (Optional)
    firstRequestOnly    If set to true only the first request received by the web site is
                        redirected to the mobileUrl when the site is accessed from a mobile
                        device. (Optional – defaults to true)
    timeout             The number of minutes of inactivity that should occur before the 
                        requesting device should be treated as making a new request to the
                        web site for the purposes of redirection. If the session is available
                        the session timeout will be used and override this value. (Optional
                        -defaults to 20 minutes)
    devicesFile	        A file used to store the details of devices that have previously
                        accessed the web site to determine if they're making a subsequent
                        request. Needed to ensure multiple worker processes have a consistent
                        view of previous activity. (Optional – random behaviour will be 
                        experienced if not specified on web sites with more than one worker
                        processes). In Windows Azure this value becomes the name of devices
						            cloud table that will be used instead of a file.
    mobilePagesRegex    A regular expression that when applied to the current request Path
                        (context.Request.AppRelativeCurrentExecutionFilePath) or the requesting 
                        Urlwill return true if it should be considered a mobile page. Use 
                        this attribute to tell redirection about mobile pages derived from base
                        classes such as System.Web.UI.Page. Redirection needs to be aware of
                        mobile pages so that requests to these pages can be ignored. Any page
                        that derives from System.Web.UI.MobileControls.MobilePage will 
                        automatically be treated as a mobile page irrespective of this 
                        attribute. (Optional)
    originalUrlAsQueryString
                        If set to true the redirected URL will have the original requesting Url 
                        encoded and included as the origUrl query string parameter in the 
                        redirected Url. This will enable the mobile home page to determine the 
                        original requested resource providing the option to display a mobile
                        friendly version. (Optional – defaults to false)
    locations/location  Provides details of different locations requests can be directed to based
                        on the values of defined properties associated with the device or request.
                        (Optional)
      name              A unique identifier for the location. Used for debugging in the log file.(Mandatory)                  
      url               the URL of the redirect location to use if all the properties in the 
                        collection match. (Mandatory)
      matchExpression   can be used to provide a regular expression which will take the requesting
                        URL as input match segments to be used in place of numeric parameters contained
                        within {} in the url attribute. (Optional)                       
                        The location element contains a collection of criteria that all need to match 
                        for the location to be used. Two attributes must be specified with each entry.
      property          the property of HttpRequest, HttpRequest.Browser or 51Degrees.mobi property to 
                        use when evaluating the matchExpression attribute. (Mandatory)
      matchExpression   a regular expression used to evaluate the value of the property. (Mandatory)

    <!--<detection> element controls where the data files used are provided. If it is not present
    the embedded device data will be used. This is the default behaviour.
    If a Premium/Ultimate Data license key is present in a file with the extension .lic in the bin 
    folder, or provided in the FiftyOne.Foundation.Mobile.Detection.Constants.PremiumLicenceKey 
    constant the binaryFilePath attribute of the detection element must be provided and the worker

    enabled         Controls whether device detection is enabled. Defaults to true. (Optional)
    autoUpdate      When set to true enables automatic updating of device data when licence keys 
                    are provided. Defaults to true. (Optional)
    binaryFilePath  Path to the binary data file. (Optional - Lite / Mandatory - Premium / Enterprise)
    shareUsage      Set to true to share usage information with 51Degrees.mobi. Read the Usage Data FAQ 
                    to learn more. Defaults to True if not specified. (Optional)
    memoryMode      True if the data set should be loaded into memory. Detection performance will be

    <!-- <imageOptimisation> elements controls the operation of the image optimiser. If not specified
    the functionality is disabled.
    
    enabled     Controls whether image optimisation is enabled. Defaults to true. Device detection must
                also be enabled for image optimisation. (Optional)
    factor	    The request image dimensions of height and width are divided by this value and remainder
                subtracted from the requests height and width. The value can be used to limit the number 
                of images that can be generated and stored in the cache. For example; a value of 50 
                would result in images of width 50, 100, 150, 250, 300, etc pixels being generated. 
                Optional default to 1.
    heightParam	The name used when specifying the height of the image to return.
                Optional defaults to "h"
    maxHeight	  The maximum height in pixels the image optimiser is allowed to render. A value of 0
                indicates there is no maximum height. Optional defaults to 0.
    maxWidth	  The maximum width in pixels the image optimiser is allowed to render. A value of 0 
                indicates there is no maximum width. Optional defaults to 0.
    widthParam	The name used when specifying the width of the image to return. 
                Optional defaults to "w"
	  defaultAuto If an image is requested with a width or height set to "auto", the parameter will be 
				        changed to the value set in ‘defaultAuto’. This is most useful for clients without
				        javascript that should still be served images, such as search crawlers.
